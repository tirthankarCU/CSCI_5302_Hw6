    "### Introduction\n",
    "Particle filters, also known as Sequential Monte Carlo methods, are a powerful technique for estimating the state of a dynamic system when given partial, noisy observations. In the context of robotics, particle filters can be used for tasks such as localization, mapping, and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview of Particle Filters\n",
    "A particle filter uses a set of random samples, or particles, to represent the probability distribution of the system's state. Each particle represents a hypothesis about the true state of the system. The particle filter algorithm iteratively updates the particle set based on new observations and the system's dynamics. In this assignment, we will be using a fixed size set of particles and we will resample using a balance of existing estimates and newly sampled estimates. \n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm can be broken down into the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Initialization**: Generate an initial set of particles representing the prior distribution of the system's state.\n",
    "- **Prediction**: Update the particles based on the system's dynamics and control inputs.\n",
    "- **Update**: Take sensor observations and update the particle weights based on the likelihood of the observed measurements.\n",
    "- **Resampling**: Replace low-weight particles with newly sampled particles, eliminating highly unlikely particles, balancing between resampling using more probable existing ones and new guesses elsewhere in the state space.\n",
    "\n",
    "At each timestep, the **Prediction**, **Update**, and **Resampling** steps are performed, keeping an up-to-date set of weighted state estimates forming a multimodal distribution that is updated with a bounded compute cost per cycle."

    "In this section, you will implement a generic `ParticleFilter` class that will be usable with different motion and observation models for localization tasks. As such, it is important that you implement your solution to work for any dimensionality of world passed in. Your code should be able to determine the dimensionality of the environment from the `world_size` variable, which will be given in the form of a matrix where each row i gives the minimum and maximum allowable values (columns 0 and 1, respectively) for the ith dimension of the world.\n",
